# HMS-LULC
LULC and long-term trends of migrating raptors counted in HMS, PA

Goal:test the hypothesis that interspecific variation in species-habitat relationships occur because of differences in other ecological traits (e.g., species that are often 
considered as "forest-dwellers" can have differences in the nature and degree of their association with forest cover because some maybe less dependent on forest resources than others)
